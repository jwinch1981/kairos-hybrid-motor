# KAIROS Hybrid Motor

**KAIROS (Kinetic Autonomous Integrated Rotary Operating System)** is an open-source hybrid magnetic-gravity motor designed for sustainable, off-grid applications.

This project empowers communities to build clean, efficient motion systems using accessible materials — ideal for water pumping, power generation, and mechanical drive systems in humanitarian or remote environments.

## Features
- Permanent magnet rotor with staggered stator repulsion
- Gravity-driven pendulum with escapement for impulse balance
- Flywheel energy smoothing and optional output shaft
- Fully mechanical, no external power required
- Easy to build, modify, and replicate
